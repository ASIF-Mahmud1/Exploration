They allow us to easily compute the semantic similarity between two words, or to find the words most similar to a target word. However, in many applications we're more interested in the similarity between two sentences or short texts. In this notebook, I compare some simple ways of computing sentence similarity and investigate how they perform."

Throughout our tests, Google's Sentence Encoder looks like a better choice than InferSent. However, the Pearson correlation coefficient shows very little difference with Smooth Inverse Frequency. The differences in Spearman correlation are more outspoken. This may indicate that the Google Sentence Encoder more often gets the relative ordering of the sentences right, but not necessarily the relative differences between them."
