1,boss,"Dear Tom, I can't thank you enough for your willingness to take on the extra overtime hours this month. July is such a heavy time for vacations that staffing the line is difficult in a good year. The only way we made it through July this year, with several people sick, and all of the scheduled vacations, was because of you. So, once again, I am grateful and appreciate your willingness to go the extra mile. I can't do a lot for you, but as a token of our gratitude for your voluntary overtime work, enclosed is a $50.00 gift certificate to the grocery store at which you've mentioned shopping in the past. I wish that I could do more to thank you. I want you to know that we really appreciate your efforts on our behalf. Sincerely, George Sampson"
2,boss,"Hi Toni, This note is to thank you for doing an outstanding job in collecting the data the department needed to determine the features our customers most wanted in the new product release. Yes, I know your job is data collection and analysis, but you really stepped up on this project. The new process you used to collect the customer feedback gives me confidence that we've done the best job possible to identify the right features. The product team has also expressed their satisfaction with your new collection method. I've never seen them so interested in implementing features recommended by marketing. This is a big plus for our whole department. So, thanks once again. I really appreciate your top-notch efforts on behalf of our department. Sincerely, Mary Swanso"

Anyway, I'd love to hear all your news and I'm hoping we can get together soon to catch up. We just moved to a bigger flat so maybe you can come and visit one weekend? How's the new job? Looking forward to hearing from you! Helg"
4,possy,"Hi Helga, I've been meaning to write to you for ages now so don't worry! How did your exams go? When will you know your results? I'm sure you did brilliantly as always! As for me, I'll have been in the new job three months by the end of next week so I'm feeling more settled in. At first I felt like I had no idea what I was doing but now I realise it's normal to feel like that. There was a lot to learn � there still is actually � and I soon had to get used to the idea that I can't know everything. I used to work late a lot and at weekends but I'm slowly getting into a normal routine. Which means I'd love to come and visit! We really need a good catch up! I can't believe we haven't seen each other since Carl's wedding. How does next month sound? Anyway, I'd better get back to work. Congratulations on the new flat! Can't wait to see you! Love, Linda"

7,boss,"Dear Ms. Smith, This is to bring to your notice the erratic transportation facility organized by the company for my team members.  As you know, the understanding has been that the company would provide transportation to the team members who have come to us from other branches to help us with the current project. The erratic transport facility is eating into a lot of our working time and is hindering our work-schedule. I am sure you will understand the seriousness of the issue and arrange for proper transportation.  All our earlier verbal complaints to your department have brought forth no results, so this has prompted me to write an official complaint letter to you. I look forward to your continued co-operation,"
